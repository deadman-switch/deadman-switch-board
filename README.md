# Switch Board

The Switch Board is where deadman switches are managed. Switches can be created programmatically via deadman-switch libraries. The Switch Board is also where API keys are created and managed for access.

On the Switch Board you can visualize all active switches and their status. The individual switches can be silenced or acknowledged from the web interface.
